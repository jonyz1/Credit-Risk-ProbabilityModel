Credit Scoring Business Understanding

1. Influence of Basel II on Model Interpretability
The Basel II Accord emphasizes the importance of accurate risk measurement to ensure financial institutions hold adequate capital for their credit exposures. This regulatory framework requires models to be interpretable, transparent, and thoroughly documented. A model that is easy to understand (e.g., through clear variables like Weight of Evidence) allows banks and regulators to assess, validate, and justify credit decisions, reducing regulatory and reputational risks.

2. Need for Proxy Variables and Associated Business Risks
In this project, we lack a direct "default" label indicating whether a customer failed to meet repayment obligations. Therefore, constructing a proxy variable (such as a threshold on delinquency days or payment behavior) is essential to approximate default risk. However, reliance on proxy labels introduces potential risks:

Misclassification of customers, leading to inaccurate risk assessment
Regulatory scrutiny if the proxy lacks a sound business rationale
Financial loss from over- or under-estimating creditworthiness

Thus, careful design and validation of proxy variables are critical to ensure business relevance and compliance.

3. Trade-offs: Simple vs. Complex Models in Regulated Finance
Simple, Interpretable Model (e.g., Logistic Regression + WoE)	Complex, High-Performance Model (e.g., Gradient Boosting)
Transparent, easy to explain to regulators	Often higher predictive accuracy
Straightforward validation and monitoring	 Harder to interpret and justify decisions
Supports stress testing and scenario analysis	 Greater model risk and regulatory resistance
May underperform on complex, nonlinear patterns	 Captures complex interactions and improves risk ranking
In regulated environments, interpretability often takes priority, ensuring models align with Basel II expectations, while more complex models may be used cautiously, provided their decisions can be explained and validated.
